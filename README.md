# U-Pass Manager Project

## Overview
The U-Pass Manager project is a comprehensive, cloud-based solution designed to modernize the distribution of U-Pass cards at our university. By automating data ingestion, eligibility verification, and pass allocation, this application replaces manual, error-prone processes with a streamlined, secure, and efficient system that delivers real-time updates and analytics.

## Features

- **Data Collection and Cloud Infrastructure Setup**  
  Configure a scalable cloud infrastructure (using AWS, Azure, etc.) to host the application, ingest and validate student data, and ensure robust logging, monitoring, and automated backups.

- **Secure Login and Role-Based Access**  
  Implement multi-factor authentication and role-based access controls to ensure that distributors and administrators can securely log in and manage system functionalities.

- **Eligibility Check**  
  Verify student eligibility in real time using daily data updates, ensuring that only qualified students receive a U-Pass.

- **NFC/QR Code Scanning and Pass Allocation**  
  Enable distributors to quickly scan NFC or QR codes to allocate U-Pass cards to student records, reducing manual errors and improving efficiency.

- **Realtime Notification Service**  
  Automatically send notifications to students when their U-Pass is ready for pickup, deactivated, or when their eligibility status changes.

- **Data Analytics and Dashboard**  
  Provide administrators with detailed insights and visualizations of U-Pass usage trends, along with data export capabilities (e.g., Excel) for external reporting.

- **Testing and Maintenance**  
  Integrate comprehensive end-to-end and regression testing, along with continuous monitoring and maintenance practices, to ensure system stability and prompt issue resolution.

## Agile Development Approach
We follow agile principles by delivering functionality in iterative sprints:
- **Sprint 1**: Set up the cloud infrastructure and data ingestion pipeline.
- **Sprint 2**: Develop secure login, role-based access, and eligibility check features.
- **Sprint 3**: Implement NFC/QR scanning for pass allocation.
- **Sprint 4**: Integrate real-time notification services.
- **Sprint 5**: Build the data analytics dashboard and data export capabilities.
- **Sprint 6**: Conduct thorough end-to-end testing and set up ongoing maintenance protocols.

## User Roles

- **Student (Sam)**  
  A full-time college student who relies on public transportation. Sam benefits from a quick, NFC/QR-enabled U-Pass collection process and receives timely notifications for any changes in his pass status.

- **Distributor (Dana)**  
  Responsible for daily U-Pass issuance, Dana uses the secure U-Pass manager portal to allocate passes via NFC/QR scanning. She also updates student eligibility statuses and ensures students are promptly notified when their passes are ready.

- **Administrator (Alex)**  
  Overseeing the entire U-Pass distribution process, Alex has full access rights to manage user roles, view detailed analytics, and export comprehensive reports (e.g., for WMATA). He also ensures that student data is consistently updated in the cloud.
